This git repository contains a minimal entry page to WikiCite.

The page is available at <http://wikicite.github.io/> and <http://wikicite.org>.

## Rationale

Existing pages about WikiCite are part of other MediaWiki wikis with all of their flexibility and complexity. This page, in contrast, provides a clean starting point to get to know WikiCite without much background knowledge in Wikimedia projects.

## Technical background

The current page is build with Jekyll and hosted via GitHub pages. Content can be modified in Markdown format and YAML configuration files or directly in HTML.
